# port-drop

> Bind to a port and drop privileges.

## Why?

 - Running as root is unsafe.
 - Ports below 1024 require root privileges.
 - Drop privileges fast by binding to a port early.

## Install

```sh
npm install port-drop --save
```

## Usage

Get it into your program.

```js
const portDrop = require('port-drop');
```

Allocate file descriptors for some ports you intend to use and immediately drop privileges.

```js
const fd = portDrop.allocate({
    http  : 80,
    https : 443
});
```

The returned `fd` object has the same properties as the input object, but with the values being file descriptors. You can then pass these to Node's [Server#listen()](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_server_listen_handle_callback) method, for example.
